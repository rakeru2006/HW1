# Home Work 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Task

**Note**: Be sure to review the [Homework Guide](../04-Important/Homework-Guide/README.md) and the [Good README Guide](../04-Important/Good-README-Guide/README.md) before you start working on this assignment!

This week is an odd-numbered week, so your homework is an on-the-job ticket, which means you'll begin with starter code that you need to modify. This week's homework involves a very important aspect of web development: **accessibility**. 

-One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. In this homework, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible._ 

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

Even though accessibility is a broad topic that can include complex requirements, your tech lead has given you a small list of specific criteria to satisfy the project. These criteria are documented below in the Acceptance Criteria.

1. Item 1 **Important**: An important rule to follow when working with someone else's code is the **Scout Rule**, which recommends that you always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it.

To impress clients, you should always go the extra mile and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. 

2. Item 2 For example, make sure that all links are functioning correctly.



3. Item 3 Also, rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

Are you ready to jump in? Here are this week's homework requirements:

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
 I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
 SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```
4. Item 4 Site is optimized for search engines
```
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="description" content=" Search Engine Optimization (SEO)">
    <meta name="keywords" content=" Management,ranking, Social Media, Marketing ">
    <meta name="author" content=" Horiseon">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/style.css">
```

**
## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
##Basic HTML tags
There are some important tagsto create an HTML document:
```
<body> for content
<head> for information about the document
<div> division within content
<a> for links
<strong> to make the text bold
<br> for line breaks
<H1> … <H6> for titles within content
<img> to add images to the document
<ol> for ordered lists, <ul> for unordered lists, <li> for elements within the list
<p> for paragraphs
<span> for styles of a part of the text
```

## Usage 
:speech_balloon:  :hammer: :eyeglasses:

We are going to create this code to show the basic steps to  use css

## Using CSS by id

Small description 
About the IDs:
An ID is defined in the HTML code like this:

```
<div id = "name_de_id">
<! - properties ... ->
</div>
```
In the CSS file we can locate the name of the previous identifier to apply the styles 
by adding a # at the beginning and then the description of the styles that we want it to contain, as follows:
```
#id_name {
background: black;
}
```
They are defined by the pound sign (#), and
they have priority over all styles applied through a class.

## Using CSS by class


About the Classes:
Classes are used in HTML like this:
```
<div class = "class_name">
<! - properties ... ->
</div>
```
And they are defined in the CSS file as follows:
```
.class_name {
background: red;
}
```
To use the classes we have to define or call them using a period `(.)` Preceding the class name.

The advantages are that they can be used multiple times per page in any number of elements.

You can even mix several classes and apply them to the same element on the page:
```
<div class = "class_name1 class_name2 class_name3">
```

## Running in our app 

Example  for class 

In the html you can find 

```
<div class="header">
```

In the Css file we use like this : 

```
/*  All elements header have this properties   */
.header {
    padding: 20px;
    font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #2a607c;
    color: #ffffff;
}
```

Example using ID 

In the html you can find 

```
 <p id="p_yellow">
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility and find the right customers for your business.
            </p>

```
In the Css file we use like this : 
```
/*  Change color de todos los parrafos del documento  */
#p_yellow{
    font-size: 16px;
    background-color: yellow;
}
```
